__ELEGANT CODE__

This repo contains all of the elegant code + lattice files I have used + created. Some other files such as the ASML lattice aren't included here as they may be confidential.
Included for now are the elegant trial codes I have wrote and attempted to run as well as the PERLE lattices and the future DIANA lattice + related code such as the SDDS to Mathematica
code and packages required for plotting of floor plans
