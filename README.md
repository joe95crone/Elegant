__ELEGANT CODE__

This repo contains all of the elegant code + lattice files I have used + created. Some other files such as the ASML lattice aren't included here as they may be confidential.
Included for now are the elegant trial codes I have wrote and attempted to run as well as the PERLE lattices and the future DIANA lattice + related code such as the SDDS to Mathematica
code and packages required for plotting of floor plans

[22/03/2021] Supplementary code has been added, which includes the elegant Mathematica interpreter and the SDDS Mathematica interpreter. The MAD conversion package seems to be missing...

[22/03/2021] The PERLE V1 and V2 lattice files and their optimisation code, output files etc. have all been uploaded with the shell files that I have created to see the lattice also included.

[22/03/2021] The trial file contains my initial elegant work which includes simple optimisations, tracking and output files to do custom plotting etc. for both a dogleg case and a bunch compressor. This code represents my own personal tutorials.
